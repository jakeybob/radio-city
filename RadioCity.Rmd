# Overview

The information here is sourced from the Scottish Public Health Observatory ([ScotPHO](https://www.scotpho.org.uk/)[@ScotPHO]), which faciliates the comparison of different health and social indicators across different geogrphical areas and time.

After dowloading a data archive via this tool, values from Garnock Valley and Kilbirnie areas were compared to Scotland level data (see `top_indicators.R` code). The following indicators were selected for further investigation:

<!-- * Young people living in the most income deprived quintile             -->
<!-- * Population within 500 metres of a derelict site                      -->
<!-- * Child protection with parental alcohol misuse                        -->
<!-- * All-cause mortality among the 15-44 year olds                        -->
<!-- * Drug-related hospital stays, aged 11-25 years                        -->
<!-- * Road traffic accident casualties                                     -->
<!-- * Children referred to the Children's Reporter for care and protection -->
<!-- * Child protection with parental drug or alcohol misuse                -->
<!-- * Child protection with parental drug misuse                           -->
<!-- * People living in 15% most 'access deprived' areas -->

* *Alcohol related hospital stays*, ages 11-25 years
* *Drug-related hospital stays*, aged 11-25 years   
* *Employment rate* for 16-24 year olds
* Population within 500 metres of a *derelict site* 
* Young people living in the most *income deprived* quintile         

The time trend for these indicators (compared to the Scottish national value for comparison purposes) can be seen below.

Interactive time trends and maps are presented for these indicators in the following sections.

# Alcohol Related Hospital Stays

The national trend is a decrease for alcohol related hospital stays for this age group (11–25 years). While North Ayrshire and NHS Ayrshire & Arran have closed the gap somewhat, they remain consistently and significantly above the national average.

# Drug Related Hospital Stays

North Ayrshire and NHS Ayrshire & Arran follow the national trend for drug related stays for this age group (11–25 years), and they remain consistently and significantly above the national average

# Employment Rate

The employment rate for young people (16–24 years) in North Ayrshire and NHS Ayrshire & Arran has been  *significantly* lower than the national average in the recent past, acheiving above average performance in just one year out of the fourteen shown.

# Derelict Sites

All of the geographies presented show a significantly higher proportion of the population live within 500m of a derelict site. Notably the Kilbirnie North, and Kilbirnie South & Longbar zones, exhibit some 2.5&#215; the national average.

# Income Deprivation

The following geographies show consistently more young people living in the most deprived quintile when compared to the national average: NHS Ayrshire & Arran, Garnock Valley, Kilbirnie South & Longbar, and North Ayrshire. The value of this indicator in the area of Kilbirnie North has consistently risen since 2014 and is now ~12% above the national average.
