# Overview

The information here is sourced from the Scottish Public Health Observatory ([ScotPHO](https://www.scotpho.org.uk/)) which allows you to compare different health and social indicators across areas and time.

## Inequalities
Notable inequalities in the Garnock Valley and Kilbirnie areas include:

* Young people living in the most income deprived quintile            
* Population within 500 metres of a derelict site                     
* Child protection with parental alcohol misuse                       
* All-cause mortality among the 15-44 year olds                       
* Drug-related hospital stays, aged 11-25 years                       
* Road traffic accident casualties                                    
* Children referred to the Children's Reporter for care and protection
* Child protection with parental drug or alcohol misuse               
* Child protection with parental drug misuse                          
* People living in 15% most 'access deprived' areas                   
* Young people living in the most access deprived quintile            
* Young people living in the most crime deprived quintile             
* Mid-year population estimate - all ages                             
* Quit attempts                                                       
* Exposure to secondhand smoke at 6-8 weeks                           
* Premature births                                                    
* Early deaths from coronary heart disease (<75)                      
* Drug-related hospital stays
