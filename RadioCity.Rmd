# Overview

The information here is sourced from the Scottish Public Health Observatory ([ScotPHO](https://www.scotpho.org.uk/)[@ScotPHO]), which faciliates the comparison of different health and social indicators across different geogrphical areas and time.

By dowloading a data archive from this tool, values from Garnock Valley and Kilbirnie areas were compared to Scotland level data (see `top_indicators.R` code). The following indicators were selected for further investigation:

<!-- * Young people living in the most income deprived quintile             -->
<!-- * Population within 500 metres of a derelict site                      -->
<!-- * Child protection with parental alcohol misuse                        -->
<!-- * All-cause mortality among the 15-44 year olds                        -->
<!-- * Drug-related hospital stays, aged 11-25 years                        -->
<!-- * Road traffic accident casualties                                     -->
<!-- * Children referred to the Children's Reporter for care and protection -->
<!-- * Child protection with parental drug or alcohol misuse                -->
<!-- * Child protection with parental drug misuse                           -->
<!-- * People living in 15% most 'access deprived' areas -->

* *Alcohol related hospital stays*, ages 11-25 years
* *Drug-related hospital stays*, aged 11-25 years   
* *Employment rate* for 16-24 year olds
* Population within 500 metres of a *derelict site* 
* Young people living in the most *income deprived* quintile         

The time trend for these indicators (compared to the Scottish national value for comparison purposes) can be seen below.
